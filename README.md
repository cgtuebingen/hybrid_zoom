# hybrid_zoom
We build a computational camera for a single camera and a single-shot hybrid zooming. We insert a phase-only SLM in the intermediate image plane to alter the
chief rays and then form the image on the sensor with a relay lens. The SLM functions as a programmable optical device whose encoded phase image is to be determined.
This repository is the simulation of the hybrid zoom based on the spatial light modulator (SLM) camera setup. It is a raytracer tha renders the optical modulaiton process by following the path of the ray across the SLM to the image sensor.
